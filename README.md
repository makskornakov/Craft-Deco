# Craft Deco factorio mod

[Home page](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/craft-deco?from=search)

Adds a couple of tweaks to let players decorate factories using in game decorative entities and trees.

Any ideas, corrections, comments and contributions to source code are appreciated.

Portions of the code (entity_ingredients function and some more) were adapted from [Dectorio mod](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Dectorio).
